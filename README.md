The `codeA1` folder contains the latest version of the organized code, and this is the main reference to use. 

The files `Exp1` to `Exp5` represent the code for Experiments 1 to 5. 

Inside the `Exp3` folder, there are three subfolders corresponding to the three sub-experiments within Experiment 3. 

The code in `Exp1` explores the impact of resource reduction on the degree of "involution"; 

`Exp2` investigates the effect of population growth on the degree of "involution"; 

`Exp3` examines the effect of increased costs for the three strategies on the degree of "involution"; 

`Exp4` studies the effect of reduced working hours on the degree of "involution"; 

and `Exp5` focuses on the effect of increased "involution" utility on the degree of "involution". 

The `description` folder contains code for visualizing the three strategies.
